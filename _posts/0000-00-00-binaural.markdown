I worked with a partner in my second semester of Quantitative Engineering Analysis (a two-semester course) to write and examine two different methods of generating binaural audio in MATLAB. The first method attempted to do so by using theoretical audio models and the second utilized experimental data. I worked on the latter.

We had mixed success. In my case, this was partly due to various difficulties I encountered during data collection. More information on why our results were lackluster can be found on our [website](https://sites.google.com/view/qeabinauralsoundgeneration/home?authuser=0), as well as the methodology we used and the results of the user-testing we conducted to assess the accuracy of our binaural audio generation programs.
