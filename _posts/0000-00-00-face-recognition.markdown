Facial recognition was the focus of my second project in QEA, an experimental class to teach students quantitative analysis skills in a real context. We learned linear algebra while also learning about facial recognition algorithms.

I did research on several methods of facial recognition before deciding to focus on two: the Eigenface and Linear Correlation methods. I wrote code for both and compared the memory, speed, and accuracy of the two programs under different conditions (variable lighting, expressions, position, and so on). I put my findings in a short paper. The PDF is below. Fair warning, some of the formatting is a little messed up.
