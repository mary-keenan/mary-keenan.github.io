My final project for Mobile Prototyping, an Android development class, was an app named Beakon. I worked on a four-person team for the last seven weeks of the semester to design and build an app that connects aspiring activists to small-scale, crowd-sourced social movements, like #NoDAPL or local protests.

One of our team members, Erica, created a trailer to explain the purpose of our app and demonstrate how to use it. The video is included below. I recommend checking it out; itâ€™s informative and pretty intense!

We coded in Java using the Android SDK. You can find our code in our [Github repository](https://github.com/mary-keenan/Beakon). We use Facebook authentication for user login and Firebase to store our user, hashtag, and movement information. We also utilize GeoFire to save location data to our database so we can suggest movements to users based on their location.
